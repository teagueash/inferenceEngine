# inference Engine

# Project Description

After the high profile lawsuit in which you succeeded to bring Reality Man to justice after proving that distributing his Nintendo emulator was a criminal act, everyone wants to hire you! From disputes over tech patents, to lawsuits on questions of privacy in social media, to suits on liability issues with self driving cars to discputes between Hollywood celebrities and their agents or producers, you are just running out of time and errgy to run all these cases by hand like we have done in lecture.  Because of the highly sensitive nature of the cases you handle, and because of the extremeley high monitary amounts involved, you cannot trust any existing.  You thus decide to build your own, ultra-optimized inference engine. After much debating, you decide the knowledge bsaes which you will create to handle each case will contain sentences with the following defined operators: 

NOT X  ----> ~X
X OR Y ---->  X | Y
